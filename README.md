1) Queso and Greco comparison: Plot effective area, resolution as function of true energy and direction, background rates, and energy distribution. Split into interaction types and compare QUESO vs GRECO datasets (fixed wrong weights and rates from QUESO). 
2) Csky background: We have the effective area, resolution, neutrino background rate and muon background. Now we want to calculate background expectations in csky and then start our analysis.
