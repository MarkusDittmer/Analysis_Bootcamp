# Analysis_Bootcamp
Stores Jupyter notebook to properly calculate and plot analysis properties before jumping into csky. Notebooks can just be viewed and not executed as of yet.


1) Basic quantities: Plot effective area, resolution as function of true energy and direction, background rates, and energy distribution.
2) Queso and Greco comparison: Properly split into interaction types and compare effective area of both datasets. Resolution and stuff below is still a placeholder
3) Background: Before using csky we need to calculate the background rates, but we have a bug in our code...
