1) Queso and Greco comparison: Plot effective area, resolution as function of true energy and direction, background rates, and energy distribution. Properly split into interaction types and compare effective area of both datasets. Resolution and stuff below is still a placeholder
2) Csky testing: We have the effective area, resolution, neutrino background rate and muon background. Now we want to calculate background expectations in csky and then start our analysis.
